Rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure and all the terrible things that it's going to bring seems to be more effective. And that maps very well to what's known about the neural circuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting your body and brain into a mode of activation, getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure that puts you into forward motion towards your goals is absolutely key. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. There were other things too, of course, the dopamine system and the power of subjective top-down control in regulating that dopamine system.

But actually now the consumption of Adderall without prescription is higher than the consumption of cannabis in that age group. So what that means is that there's a lot of stimulant use in that age group. And there are a lot of adults also using and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus. Now we could have a whole discussion about whether or not life is becoming more demanding, whether or not the need for focus is excessive, and that's why people are doing that.

I think it's very like offensive even to certain people. This idea of inheritance of acquired traits, the idea that one could change themselves through some activity, use the example of going to the gym. We could also use the example of somebody who becomes an endurance runner, then decides to have children within another endurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this running and not just because they were biased towards running in the first place, but because of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners. Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong. So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits? What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion? Right.

Typically, we see that the responses last not only with the viral resistance, but also with other traits for a few generations, three to five generations. We found genes that function as a sort of a clock that times the duration of the inheritance. What sorts of genes are those? So we call these genes MOTEC genes. MOTEC, I don't know how is your Hebrew, but MOTEC, it means sweetheart in Hebrew. But the acronym is Modified Transgenerational Epigenetic Kinetics. There are different types of genes like that.

I'm also trying to take that visual window and actually pay attention to more of the details at that location.

It's also responsible for falling asleep. It's responsible for us feeling relaxed. It is responsible for most of the states of mind and body in which we are quiescent, where we don't feel an impulse to move, or when we have a difficult time getting into action. So the sympathetic and the parasympathetic aspect of the autonomic nervous system are always in a push-pull with one another. Think of them more or less on a teeter-totter. When one end goes up, the other end goes down. They're really in competition with one another and it's their balance that reflects how alert or how sleepy we happen to be. Now, the reason I'm giving you this rather geeky nerd speak nomenclature filled discussion about the autonomic nervous system in the context of willpower is that regardless of whether or not you believe willpower is a limited or an unlimited resource, we know one thing for sure, and that's that willpower and tenacity ride on our current autonomic function.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In the episode \\\"How to Increase Your Willpower & Tenacity\\\" from the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman explores the psychological and neurological underpinnings of tenacity and willpower.

That is the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems of your autonomic nervous system are in the best possible balance to generate tenacity and willpower. We don't yet have such a metric, although there are companies that are starting to develop devices that hopefully will give us indices of autonomic function or dysfunction. But it is important that we acknowledge that if you're not taking care of the foundational modulators of tenacity and willpower, none of the subsequent tools and protocols that we will discuss are going to help you that much over time. You might get tenacity and willpower to engage one day when you're very sleep deprived, but it's going to be very difficult to consistently engage tenacity and willpower.

Dr. Sobel explains the science behind olfaction, our sense of smell, and chemosensation, our response to chemicals in the environment. They explore the surprising abilities of human olfaction, such as how we process chemical information from others to determine stress levels, hormone states, and even how tears can affect our hormone levels. The conversation covers the phenomenon of nasal cycling, which reflects the dynamic of our nervous system and impacts alertness. Dr. Sobel's work reveals that we are constantly sensing our own odors and subconsciously smelling ourselves to change cognition and behavior. Additionally, the discussion touches on the nasal cycle's connection to the autonomic nervous system and its potential as a non-invasive marker for conditions like ADHD. Finally, Dr. Sobel shares insights into the subconscious ways humans use smell for social interactions, such as identifying individuals and forming\\nShow Guest: Dr. Noam Sobel\\nTranscript: And it turns out that this is linked to balance in the autonomic nervous system. So as you and your listeners know, we have an autonomic nervous system that has a sympathetic and parasympathetic component to it. And they're in balance or imbalance in many diseases, for example. And this interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system drives the switch from left to right nostril. Yeah. Just to remind people, sympathetic nervous system has nothing to do with sympathy, has everything to do with generating patterns of alertness. It's sometimes called the fight or flight system, but any pattern of arousal, positive or negative, and then it's balanced in a coordinated way, or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic nervous system, which is sometimes called the rest and digest system, but is associated with all sorts of things, the sexual arousal response, and a number of other aspects of our physiology. So think of it like a seesaw of alertness and calm. Yeah? Perfect. So now imagine, right?

Perfectly stated, yeah. There's only a few medications that are actually FDA-approved specifically for pain. So what we do is we borrow or steal from the psychiatrists some of their antidepressants, which will frequently work very effectively for pain, and work on those pain-related circuits in the brain. We take from the neurologist some of the anti-seizure medications because those medications, while reducing separately seizures, for people who don't have seizures, they work on ion channels. They work on other neuromodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry. We can take from the cardiologists medications that work on the heart, antiarrhythmia or heart rhythm drugs.

The podcast emphasizes that mental training and visualization, when done correctly, can significantly improve the acquisition and retention of skills, be it cognitive tasks, musical abilities, or motor skills in sports. Huberman highlights the importance of neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to adapt and change through experience, as the underlying mechanism that supports the benefits of mental training.\\n\\nTo maximize the effectiveness of mental training and visualization, it must be structured in brief, specific, and repeated sessions that mirror the actual physical or cognitive tasks being trained.

The podcast also explores individual differences in visualization capabilities and provides insights into how people with conditions like autism or synesthesia might experience mental imagery and visualization differently.

If you're going to go with third person visualization, try and go with real third person visualization where you're actually seeing and or hearing yourself on a screen.

However, he cautions against over-supplementation, as it can be unproductive or even harmful. He advocates for precision supplementation based on individual biological testing to provide only what is necessary for each person. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Galpin also discuss creatine as a top supplement due to its wide-ranging benefits for muscle performance, cognitive function, and potential impacts on bone density and neurological health. They stress the importance of consistent supplementation over time to raise baseline functioning and improve resilience. The conversation includes a detailed look at hydration strategies and the potential consequences of both dehydration and overhydration.\\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\\nTranscript: And so because caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist effectively, while caffeine is present in those receptors, you don't feel as sleepy. You have more energy. Your reaction time goes down. Memory is enhanced, focus, performance of all kinds. Yes, but then when that caffeine is dislodged from the receptor, then the adenosine can act even more potently at those receptors. So it's sort of like being able to borrow against the normal variations in wakefulness and sleep. And this is why we encourage people, if they're not training first thing in the morning, to push their caffeine intake out about 90 to 120 minutes after waking so they can clear some of that adenosine in the morning, which tends to happen even after we wake up. People can listen to episodes on Master Your Sleep or Perfect Sleep or the caffeine episode to understand more about that. But the final thing I just want to say here, and then it prompts a question, is in thinking about supplement protocols, I think a lot of people assume that once they start taking something, they're going to have to take it all the time.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In episode 72 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the science of memory and how to improve it using science-based tools. He explains that memory is not just about learning, but also about placing life events into context, linking immediate experiences with past and future ones. Huberman promises to make the science accessible and discusses specific protocols grounded in extensive research that can enhance learning and memory. The episode also touches on unlearning and forgetting, providing tools to reduce the emotional weight of negative experiences. Additionally, he covers topics like deja vu, photographic memory, and how to use the visual system to improve memory. Huberman emphasizes that these insights are based on a solid understanding of brain systems and are separate from his roles at Stanford, aligning with his mission to distribute zero-cost consumer information about science.\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: Now, caffeine in the form of coffee or yerba mate or any other form of caffeine does create a sense of alertness in our brain and body. And it does that through two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is by blocking the effects of adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body the longer that we are awake. And it's largely what's responsible for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue when we've been awake for a very long time. Caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of adenosine. It's a competing agonist, not to get technical, but it binds to the receptor for adenosine for some period of time and prevents adenosine from having its normal pattern of action and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue. But it also increases state of alertness. So while it's reducing fatigue, it's also pushing on neurochemical systems in order to directly increase our alertness. And it does that in large part by increasing the transmission of epinephrine, adrenaline, in the brain and body.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \\\"How to Stop Headaches Using Science-Based Approaches\\\" features Dr. Andrew Huberman discussing various types of headaches, including migraines, tension headaches, and cluster headaches, and their underlying biology. He emphasizes that understanding the specific type of headache and its biological basis is key to selecting effective treatments. Huberman explores both pharmaceutical and natural remedies, emphasizing that many natural treatments can be as effective, if not more so, than drugs, without the side effects. He also debunks the misconception that natural treatments are not scientifically grounded, explaining that they are based on a solid understanding of headache mechanisms. The episode also covers the role of muscular tension, vasodilation, meningeal irritation, and neural and inflammatory responses in causing headaches. Huberman provides insights into how the nervous system processes pain, the importance of distinguishing between different types of headaches, and the potential treatments for each.\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: Well, one of the main ways in which caffeine makes us more alert is that it occupies the receptors for something called adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body more and more the longer we've been awake. It's one of the things that makes us feel sleepy. So when we drink caffeine, that caffeine occupies the adenosine receptor and the adenosine cannot have its normal effect of making us sleepy. When that caffeine wears off, the adenosine can bind and we feel sleepy. Adenosine is a vasodilator. So when we drink caffeine, because it blocks the effects of adenosine, there is a vasoconstriction associated with drinking caffeine. So if you have a headache that is associated with excessive vasodilation and pressure in the head, indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction by preventing that adenosine pathway that would normally lead to vasoconstriction, and you can get some relief from that headache. However, caffeine is also a vasodilator.\\n------------------------\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.8250912786885273, "reason": "The output accurately describes how caffeine interacts with adenosine receptors in the brain and its subsequent effects on wakefulness and sleepiness, aligning well with the information requirement stated in the input.

He explains the concept of intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, which involves eating during specific periods of a 24-hour cycle. The episode explores how different schedules of eating can impact health in numerous ways, such as influencing fat loss, muscle dynamics, organ function, and even cognitive and mood states. Huberman emphasizes the importance of the timing of food intake, as it is as crucial as what is eaten. He also introduces tools and strategies to help manage eating schedules without being overly strict, including ways to mitigate the negative effects of occasionally deviating from a set fasting schedule. The episode discusses a study on fasting blood glucose as a predictor of mortality, highlighting the differences between human and mouse studies, and stresses the importance of considering the species when interpreting research on diet and health\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: Now, is the increase in blood glucose that occurs from high intensity interval training early in the day, is that detrimental? Not necessarily so. That oftentimes is associated with the shuttling of nutrients to the muscles that have just done a lot of hard work. So it's not that high intensity interval training should not be done early in the day. In fact, for many people, including myself, training early in the day, just for the way that my psychology and biology works is always better for me than training later in the day. And the other important thing to mention is that high intensity interval training done late in the day can be beneficial from the perspective of glucose clearing, lowering blood glucose and helping transition from the fed to the fasted state in preparation for sleep. However, if you're ingesting caffeine or anything to engage in that high intensity interval training in a way that prevents you from getting to sleep, well, then it's going to be detrimental overall.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \\\"Science-Supported Tools to Accelerate Your Fitness Goals,\\\" host Dr. Andrew Huberman and guest Dr. Andy Galpin discuss science-based strategies for enhancing fitness routines.

Huberman highlights select protocols he has incorporated into his routine that are fun and time-efficient and encourages listeners to tailor these strategies to their goals without significantly increasing workout duration.\\n\\nKey components of any fitness program consist of a combination of cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. The episode emphasizes the necessity of including different training types (like zone two cardio, strength sessions, and different cardiovascular workouts) and recovery to make continuous progress.\\n\\nSpecific tools discussed include \\\"meshing\\\" zone two cardio with daily activities, like walking, to hit the recommended 200 minutes per week without additional scheduling.\\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\\nTranscript: It's the kind of thing that you might throw in once every two weeks or once every four weeks as a replacement for your other high intensity interval training.

For others of you, it will be a road bike. For others of you, it will be running. And for others of you, it will be rowing. The exact form of exercise is not important. What is important is that you can generate a lot of intensity. So you're going to be doing some sprint-like work, although not all out sprints, except on the final round. I'll explain where all this is going in a moment. But again, you need to select a movement that you can do without injuring yourself while still performing a movement at high intensity.

The conversation also debunks the myth that lifting weights is only for muscle gain, highlighting the importance of endurance for overall health.\\n\\nDr. Galpin introduces the concept of mechanical efficiency, particularly in breathing and posture, as key to improving endurance quickly. Nasal breathing is suggested as a simple technique to enhance breathing mechanics. The episode also explores the idea of \\\"exercise snacks,\\\" short bouts of intense exercise like running up stairs, which can improve cardiovascular fitness and metabolic health even in an office setting.\\n\\nFurthermore, the discussion covers the crossover concept, where different intensities of exercise utilize varying fuel sources (fat vs. carbohydrates), and the misconception that training fasted\\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\\nTranscript: Is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic capacity? Keeping in mind what you said before, which is that specificity or precision, as you've raised it, is important. That is, if I want to train anaerobic capacity for sprinting, I probably should have been sprinting. Cycling, I was on the assault bike and so on. How many of those one minute all out sprints or 30 second all out sprints on the bike could and should one perform per workout and per week? So marching through exercise choice. Yep, let's do it. Order, volume, frequency and progression. Yep. Choice of exercises, train for what you want to improve. Is that right? Not necessarily. So in this particular case, if you have a specific goal, yes, of course, do it. Exercise choice, a couple of things you want to look for.

He advises listeners on structuring their training plans to make consistent progress and offers strategies for those with varying time constraints and equipment access. The conversation also covers the importance of having a specific plan for training and the role of progressive overload in achieving fitness goals. Dr. Galpin suggests that adherence to a structured plan can lead to better results compared to a non-structured approach.

And I actually think there's some real gems of information in the study design that you described. So just cue that for maybe a potential collaboration between our laboratories. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's very important, but it does cue up another question relevant to fitness in particular, which is what are your thoughts on intermediate goals? So let's say my goal is to drop two percentages, 2% of body fat from where I am now, a year from now, roll into the next year from now, about 2% lower on body fat, but maintain my lean body mass, or maybe even increase it. Yep. How should I assess progress? You know, because the dopamine system loves a goal that it loves anticipation of a goal, but it responds best to, we sort of re-up, if you will, our dopamine.

So I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying that dynamic and ballistic stretching are not useful. They absolutely are. But in terms of increasing limb range of motion in the longterm of truly becoming more flexible as opposed to transiently more flexible, static stretching, which includes PNF, appears to be the best route to go. So if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion for a given muscle group, or perhaps for all muscle groups, although you can imagine that'd be pretty tough. I mean, you're not going to spend time, I could imagine, working on your tongue muscle control or neck muscle control and every muscle control, but most of us want to reduce so-called tightness, in air quotes, and increase limb range of motion for certain muscle groups.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In episode 76 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the importance of flexibility and stretching for movement, injury prevention, inflammation reduction, and even impacting tumor growth.

I realize that's a controversial area. You have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial. You have those who say, no, it inhibits performance. And those that say, no, it's a matter of how exactly you perform that static stretching and which muscle groups and how you're doing this and how much time in between static stretching and performance. But to leave all that aside, doing static stretching after some other form of exercise, and if not after some form of exercise, after a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature, definitely seems like the right way to go. Now, for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well, doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment, even if that commitment is one to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches.

In general, to avoid injury, it's a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit before doing these kinds of stretches, even these static stretches, which we can sort of ease into and don't involve ballistic movement by definition. And the basic takeaway that I was able to find was that if we are already warm from running or from weight training or from some other activity, that doing the static stretching practice at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular or other physical session would allow us to go immediately into the stretching session because we're already warm, so to speak. Otherwise, raising one's core body temperature by a bit by doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements, provided you can do those without getting injured, seems to be an ideal way to warm up the body for stretching. We should be warm or warm up to stretch, although those warmups don't have to be extremely extensive.

Absolutely. It's just more combinations, more ways, more information. There are the modifications of the DNA, and also there are the modifications of the proteins which condense the DNA that are called histones. So they are also modified by many different chemicals. Again, methylation is a very common modification, acetylation, even serotonin, the serotoninylation of histones. Serotonin. Right. This is a new paper from Nature from a few years ago.

Dr. Rech\\nShow Guest: Dr. Oded Rechavi\\nTranscript: The way DNA works is that you inherit a copy for every chromosome from your mother and your father. And then you have in every cell of your body two copies, if you're a human, of every chromosome. So every gene is represented twice. These are called alleles, the different versions of the genes. And the thought is that once you enter the next generation, the two copies that you inherited are equal. It doesn't matter whether you acquire them from your mother or from your father, right? There are some situations where it does matter. There is a limited number of genes that are called imprinted genes where it does matter whether you inherit it from your mother or your father. And this is happening through epigenetic inheritance, not because of changes to the DNA sequence, but because of maintenance of these chemical modifications across generations. And as I recall from the beautiful work of Catherine Duloc at Harvard, that especially in the brain, there is evidence that some cells contain the complete genome from mom or the complete genome from dad. And it can also switch during your life.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In this episode, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses with Dr. Oded Rechavi the fascinating concept of genetic inheritance and the impact of parental experiences on future generations. Dr. Rechavi explains that while traditional genetic inheritance is well understood, recent evidence suggests that acquired traits and even memories can be passed down through epigenetic mechanisms. This means that experiences can modify our genes in ways that affect our offspring and even multiple generations down the line.\\n\\nDr. Rechavi provides an accessible overview of genetics, epigenetics, and the mechanisms by which certain experiences can lead to genetic modifications. He emphasizes the importance of RNA in potentially mediating these transgenerational effects. The conversation also touches on the complexities of distinguishing between genetic and environmental influences on traits and the ongoing debates in the scientific community regarding the extent of epigenetic inheritance in humans.\\n\\nThe episode delves into the significance of model organisms like C. elegans (nematodes) in studying these genetic phenomena. Dr. Rech\\nShow Guest: Dr. Oded Rechavi\\nTranscript: Then the question is, if this happens, then what are the molecules that actually transmit information across generations? Are they these chemical modifications to the DNA or to the proteins that condense the DNA, or are there other agents that transmit information, and which molecules can do it? And I actually think that the most interesting players today are RNA molecules. But before I go into that, I just want to say that when we talk about the barriers to epigenetic inheritance, or the barriers to inheritance of acquired traits, in addition to the separation of the soma from the germline that we discussed, the other main barrier, it's called epigenetic reprogramming, which is that we acquired our cells, the genetic material in our cells acquires all kinds of changes, these chemical changes, modifications we discussed. But these modifications are largely erased in the transition between generations. So in the germline, in the sperm and the egg, and also in the early embryo, most of the modifications are removed so we can start a blank slate based on the genetic instructions. And this is crucial. Otherwise, according to the theory, it's not clear that it's actually true because in some organisms it doesn't really happen.\\n------------------------\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.868383944704553, "reason": "The actual output effectively captures and communicates the relationship between chemical modifications to DNA and proteins and the transmission of information across generations, aligning closely with the factual context provided in the retrieval content.

Huberman emphasizes the importance of the \\\"Big Six\\\" or six pillars of health: sleep, light/dark exposure, movement, nutrition, social connection, and stress control, which are daily practices that contribute to mood and mental health. He also discusses recent research, including a study on the benefits of darkness at night for mental health. Huberman outlines the necessity of these pillars for creating a predictable neurochemical environment conducive to positive mood and emotions. Additionally, he touches on pharmacological tools like SSRIs, atypical antidepressants, and psilocybin, which can aid neuroplasticity when combined with therapy. The episode\\nShow Guest: Lisa Feldman Barrett\\nTranscript: So there's really no strict rules about how to do this exactly, except that I do encourage you to make those increments across your lifespan manageable. I wouldn't suggest doing it one for every year. I wouldn't suggest a folder one for every 10 years. I think a three to five year increment seemed like a more reasonable and tractable way to go about this. So that's one of the sorts of tools that Dr. Conti referred to as to how to build up one's self-concept, which directly relates to things such as our confidence, our ability to track our own behavior, understand some of our motivations, both conscious and unconscious. But of course, that practice is mainly a conscious exercise. It's really not tapping directly into the unconscious in any kind of direct way as far as we know. Now we can contrast that with the tools and protocols that are designed to tap into the unconscious mind. And of course, there are a number of different ways to do this that were discussed in that four episode series with Dr. Conti. But one of the most powerful ways to do this is by thinking about, and indeed sometimes writing about, or even analyzing one's dreams.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In the episode \\\"Dr. Paul Conti: Tools and Protocols for Mental Health,\\\" Dr. Andrew Huberman and Dr. Paul Conti discuss the importance of self-care and its comprehensive definition beyond just sleep, exercise, and healthy relationships.

Dr. Conti emphasizes the significance of processing traumatic experiences and overcoming barriers to self-care, as well as engaging in practices like therapy, meditation, and journaling to enhance self-awareness and mental health. The conversation also covers the importance of understanding the unconscious mind, the role of defense mechanisms, and the impact of self-inquiry in promoting agency, gratitude, and a generative drive in life.\\nShow Guest: Dr. Paul Conti\\nTranscript: But I think it's very hard for us to place ourselves into the future of a person on our deathbed, looking back and then make really good decisions now. I think there are ways to do that, but it seems that it's far more powerful to just think about what am I doing now and come to some realizations about what is really a value now and what is of less value or no value now and then make adjustments now as opposed to doing the deathbed exercise. You have no other option if you're going to make change. I mean, think about what a complicated and ultimately meaningless exercise it is to try and project ahead into a future when one is on one's deathbed. And it's like, what is that like? I mean, we can't imagine that and we don't know who's there. Like whatever that situation may be for any of us, it's not going to be what we imagine. So then we just make something up and we try and extrapolate our lives in a way that gets us to this place where we're on our deathbed and we're not unhappy.

By understanding how those things relate to one another, I assure you that by the end of today's episode, you will be in a far better position to understand why you become amotivated, why you procrastinate, how to ensure motivation on an ongoing basis, and even how to leverage effort and the desire to become motivated as a way to do just that, to become more motivated. Today's discussion is not about psychology, although I will center around practical everyday examples and offer many, many tools that you can implement if you choose.

That pain that I'm referring to is actually a craving or a wanting, and it's a craving or wanting for a specific state that you would like to achieve that is different than the one that you're in.

MDMA, distinct from other psychedelics and stimulants, acts as an empathogen, increasing both dopamine and serotonin, which enhances social connectivity and empathy. Clinical trials have shown promising results for MDMA-assisted therapy in PTSD treatment, with changes in brain function and connectivity correlating with symptom relief. However, MDMA remains a Schedule I drug and is illegal to possess or sell in the U.S. The episode also discusses MDMA's history, its path to potential legality, and the differences between recreational and therapeutic use.

People that don't have age-related cognitive decline, that's a very high dose. Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study or to enhance learning of any kind, they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams. That's more typical. Again, you have to check with your doctor. You have to decide if the safety margins are appropriate for you. Obviously, you'll want to check that out, but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focus by way of this cholinergic system.

He delves into the subconscious signals from the gut that influence food choices, explaining that neurons in the gut send signals about nutrient content to the brain. Metabolic accessibility of food to the brain and belief about the health benefits of food also play roles in dietary preferences. Huberman emphasizes that one can change their diet to crave healthier foods through understanding these mechanisms. He also revisits the topic of time-restricted feeding, highlighting the importance of consistent eating windows for benefits like weight management and improved sleep and cognition. The episode also touches on the roles of various nutrients in brain health, including omega-3 fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, and choline, and how they contribute to neuron function and integrity.

So it has been used at those much higher concentrations, but because fortunately, at least not yet or not to my awareness, I'm not suffering from any cognitive decline, I will supplement with 300 milligrams every now and again. Next on my list of compounds that have been shown in peer-review reviewed research to improve neuronal and brain function is creatine. Creatine can be derived from meat sources. It can also be supplemented. Some of you are probably familiar with creatine or have heard about creatine from the context of the health and fitness world where creatine is used to bring more water into muscles, which can enhance the strength of those muscles, as well as bring water into other tissues. So it doesn't just draw more water into muscle, it can draw more water into the body generally. Creatine has also been shown to have an important role in brain function. And once again, this is something that came up during the discussion about depression a few episodes back, creatine can actually be used as a fuel source in the brain.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \\\"How to Learn Skills Faster,\\\" Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford, discusses the neuroscience of skill acquisition and how to optimize learning. He emphasizes the importance of errors in the learning process, as they signal the brain to focus attention and open up opportunities for neuroplasticity. Huberman advises maximizing repetitions during practice sessions and allowing the brain to rest afterward to consolidate learning. He also debunks the notion that slow movements are best for beginners, suggesting that they are more beneficial once some proficiency is achieved. Huberman touches on the use of metronomes for advanced learners to increase the pace and number of repetitions. He concludes that the key to faster skill learning is to perform many repetitions, pay attention to errors, and allow for periods of rest post-practice for the brain to process and consolidate the new skills.\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: Alpha-GPC, alpha-glycerophosphocholine.

You know, I will back to Christopher's rule for a healthy diet, a lot of the macronutrient changes that we saw in their diet were consistent with healthy changes in diet, less saturated fat, less animal-based protein, more plant-based protein. So a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial kind of came in concert with just telling people eat a high fiber diet, high plant-based fiber diet. The people that were eating the high fermented food diet, they were instructed to basically eat foods that you could buy at a grocery store that were naturally fermented and contain live microbes.

So it sounds like the Hadza, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, you said would prefer to eat meat and honey, but they happen to consume a lot of plant fiber as a consequence of what's available. One of the questions I have as it relates to all of this is it sounds to me like there is no question from the pure vegan all the way to the extreme opposite, which would be pure meat diet, that avoiding processed foods is a good idea or heavily processed foods in general. And I mean, not that the occasional consumption is necessarily bad, but whether or not one is thinking about one macronutrient profile or another, it sounds like consuming processed foods is just bad for the microbiome.

He explains that breathing is unique because it can be controlled both consciously and subconsciously, serving as a bridge between our conscious and subconscious behaviors. The podcast delves into the mechanics and chemistry of breathing, emphasizing the importance of carbon dioxide in regulating our body's pH levels and oxygen delivery. Huberman introduces the concept of the physiological sigh, a breathing pattern that rapidly reduces stress by optimizing the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide. He also addresses common misconceptions about breathing, such as the benefits of diaphragmatic breathing, and offers practical tools for improving breathing efficiency, which can enhance mental health, physical health, and performance.\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: There are a huge number of benefits that can come from doing this box breathing exercise, but you got to get the duration of the sides of the box right, and that's why you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test. One thing that many people notice after doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test even just once, and then doing this box breathing exercise once or twice a week, is that after two or three weeks, the box breathing itself becomes very easy. And in that case, I recommend taking the carbon dioxide tolerance test over again. And almost always what you'll find is that you have been able to extend your carbon dioxide discard rate. And therefore you now fall into a different category, not just the lower medium, but the long carbon dioxide discard rate category. And you are able to extend the duration of those inhale hold, exhale holds during the box breathing. And of course, the ultimate benefit of all this is that it translates to deeper and yet less frequent breathing when at rest and when not consciously paying attention to how you're breathing during the daytime. Again, if at all possible, do all of this breathing through the nose.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In the episode featuring Dr. Andy Galpin, the focus is on recovery and its pivotal role in fitness and performance enhancement. Dr. Galpin emphasizes that while stress from exercise triggers adaptation, it's the recovery phase where actual progress and adaptation occur. He discusses the importance of ensuring recovery outpaces stress to avoid negative outcomes like overtraining. Dr. Galpin also touches on his experience working with high-performing individuals and the various strategies used to aid recovery, including cost-effective methods. The conversation delves into muscle soreness, particularly delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), explaining its association with immune responses rather than muscle damage. Dr. Galpin and Dr. Huberman explore various recovery modalities, such as compression gear, thermal treatments like cold water immersion, and the role of nutrition and supplementation, which will be discussed in a future episode.\\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\\nTranscript: And of course, people could sit with lungs empty, but they have to accurately, faithfully, as we say, report how long it took them to empty their lungs. We use that as a gauge. Typically, if people go to lungs empty in 20 seconds or less, I believe, I have to go back to the paper and look, but I believe that the duration for each of the sides of the boxes, as it were, was somewhere between two and three seconds. If they had a CO2 discard time of anywhere from 20 seconds up to about 40, 45 seconds, we used the sides of the box where I believe between four and six seconds. And then for people longer than who could discard their air over a period of a minute or more, we used a box duration that is inhale hold, exhale hold duration of somewhere between, I believe it was seven or maybe it was eight and as long as 11 or 12 seconds. Because you get your kind of free diver types who can really do this, who are really well-trained for this sort of thing. Don't quote me exactly on those numbers, but that was approximate.

Dr. Gottfried, an obstetrician-gynecologist and expert in hormone health, discusses the importance of managing the gut microbiome, nutrition, and exercise for maintaining healthy hormone levels. She emphasizes the unique needs of women regarding their gut microbiome and its influence on estrogen, testosterone, thyroid, and growth hormone. The discussion also covers the importance of omega-3 fatty acids and the right balance of resistance and cardiovascular training for women. Dr. Gottfried highlights the prevalence of digestive issues in women and the tools available for overcoming them to improve hormone health. She advocates for specific types of tests, including blood, urine, and microbiome tests, for women to understand their hormone status and trajectory. The conversation also touches on navigating different life stages, from puberty to menopause, and the role of hormone replacement therapy. Dr. Gottfried's expertise extends to intergenerational factors\\nShow Guest: Dr. Sara Gottfried\\nTranscript: Another group did box breathing, inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations. The duration of each of those inhales and holds was set by their carbon dioxide tolerance. So somewhere between three and eight seconds, depending on how well they regulate to carbon dioxide. Another group did cyclic sighing. So this would be double inhale through the nose. So big inhale through the nose, followed by a two lungs empty exhale. That second inhale after the first big long inhale through the nose is really important because it makes sure that all the collapsed alveoli, the lungs snap open. And then the exhale, you offload a lot of carbon dioxide. That's very similar to holotropic breathwork. Yes, not unlike holotropic breathwork, little bit pranayama-ish, but the exhale is rather passive as opposed to active. And then the fourth category was cyclic hyperventilation, which is a lot like TUMO, aka Wim Hof-ish breathing, different than Wim Hof breathing.

Nicotine, commonly consumed through smoking, has both detrimental health effects and, in specific non-smoking modalities, potential benefits for cognitive function. Huberman explains how nicotine increases dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which can enhance focus, alertness, and mood. However, smoking and vaping, particularly among young people, are on the rise and carry significant health risks due to the damage they cause to the body's endothelial cells and the presence of carcinogens.

Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis. There's a wonderful app that was developed by Dr. David Spiegel and others. It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I. I've talked about this app a few times on the podcast before because there are hypnosis scripts within the app for enhancing sleep, for improving ability of fall asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night, for focus and a number of other behavioral and emotional changes.

As a matter of fact, if you take two different people, on average, they will have functional differences in 30% of their odor receptors. And if you do as Leslie Vossall and her colleagues did at Rockefeller University and give odor tests where they give people different things to smell and then they dilute them and find the threshold at which they can detect them, you find enormous changes from people to people, both in general terms. Some people are just better smellers than others. But in terms of individual odors as well, there's some odors that some people can't detect and other people smell one way. For example, there's a secreted hormone called androstenone. Androstenone, there are some people who can't smell it at all. For some people, it smells rather pleasant, like cut grass. And for some people, it smells foul, like urine or sweat. And it just depends on genetic variation in one particular odorant receptor.

Dr. Heller explains how the body manages heat and the importance of maintaining homeostasis. The conversation delves into how controlling core body temperature can significantly enhance both mental and physical performance in various environments. Dr. Heller also debunks myths about the best ways to cool down, emphasizing that common practices like placing a cold pack on the neck may actually impede heat loss. The episode touches on the potential of discussing Dr. Heller's work on Down syndrome and circadian rhythms in future episodes. Overall, the episode provides insights into optimizing human biology and performance through temperature regulation.\\nShow Guest: Dr. Craig Heller\\nTranscript: And typically anabolic steroids are of the testosterone variety. There are derivatives, et cetera, and those derivatives do different things and anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera. But typically the idea is, at least as I understand it in talking to some of these individuals, is that they allow people to train more because they recover faster. They are able to synthesize more protein because they're basically getting a second puberty. Because as we all know, during puberty, there's a lot of growth of the body. And of course, there are a lot of negative effects of abuse of these things. and they are banned from various sports organizations. Especially, I should mention, in combat sports, this is especially concerning because in combat sports, a performance enhancement means that you can harm somebody more than you would be able to otherwise, as opposed to in other sorts of sports, just to conceptualize it. And I'm not taking a moral stance on any of this. I just want to ask you, when you compare Palmer cooling to anabolic steroids in terms of gym performance, what do you see?\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode 66, hosted by Dr. Andrew Huberman, delves into the science and application of deliberate cold exposure for enhancing health and performance. The episode discusses how cold exposure affects the nervous system and various organs, and how it can be utilized to improve mental health, physical health, athletic performance, and cognitive function. Huberman explains the importance of understanding cold's impact on the brain and body, and outlines specific protocols for cold exposure using variables like temperature, duration, and method (e.g., showers, baths, or environmental exposure). He emphasizes the potency of temperature as a stimulus and the associated risks if not approached correctly, advising listeners to consult a physician before starting new protocols. The episode also discusses a study on the benefits of moderate aerobic exercise before cognitive tasks, suggesting that exercise can enhance focus and perceptual speed more effectively than mindfulness meditation. Huberman concludes by highlighting the importance of gradual progression in cold exposure practices and finding the minimum effective stimulus for maximum benefit.\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: And that raises perhaps the most important point, which is the way that Palmer cooling can improve performance by way of reducing core body temperature is known. And that is because when one engages in exercise or muscular output of any kind, strength or endurance exercise, the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform is actually very narrow. There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase, which is critical to muscle contractions. And pyruvate kinase can only function in a very narrow range of temperatures. If that temperature gets too hot, meaning if the muscle heats up locally, whether or not by running or cycling or swimming or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle to continue to contract is reduced and eventually is short-circuited completely. And I think this is a much under explored, or at least a much under discussed aspect of so-called muscular failure or the failure of one to continue to endure in running. So for instance, when you run as compared to a bench press or something, you don't stop running because you can't actually contract the muscles further, but somehow signals about the heating up of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain. There's a crosstalk there.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: The episode \\\"Science of Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength & Muscular Recovery\\\" with Andrew Huberman delves into the mechanisms and best practices for muscle development, strength enhancement, and recovery. Huberman explains that muscle growth, or hypertrophy, and strength gains are not solely dependent on heavy weights but can be achieved through a range of resistance exercises at 30-80% of one's maximum capacity, with the key being to perform enough sets to near failure each week. He emphasizes the importance of the nervous system in directing muscle movement and growth, highlighting the Henneman size principle, which states that muscles recruit motor units from low to high threshold to conserve energy. Huberman also discusses the benefits of resistance training for hormonal responses, such as increasing testosterone, and the impact of lactate as a hormonal signal that can improve brain, heart, and liver function when exercising at high intensity. The episode underscores the importance of tailored resistance training for individual goals, whether for muscle size, strength, speed, or\\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\\nTranscript: I'm not responsible for your health. You are, I don't say that just to protect me. I would say that also to protect you, but it really seems to improve muscular endurance, improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue. There are even some interesting effects on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass. So creatine, beta alanine, electrolytes, these are kind of the core three things that seem to improve performance and are well supported by the scientific literature. And in the earlier episode on supercharging performance, we talked about Palmer cooling. That's certainly a performance enhancing tool. It's nothing you ingest. You're cooling your palms in a very specific way. That's very powerful. Now, what about for longer duration bouts of exercise? We've mainly been focusing on resistance training, but what about for long runs, long swims, these kinds of things? Well, it does seem that beet juice and ingesting things like arginine and citrulline can improve performance for those long bouts of exercise. That's mainly going to be due to effects of those compounds on vasodilation.\\n------------------------\\n\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_metadata": {"metric": "AnswerCorrectness (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output accurately acknowledges the lack of direct comparison between anabolic steroids and Palmer cooling based on the provided retrieval context, effectively adhering to the evaluation criterion that emphasizes factual accuracy and the specific addressing of information requirements when the context does not contain sufficient information.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "evaluationCost": 0}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": false, "evaluation_steps": ["Compare the actual output with the retrieval context to verify factual accuracy.", "Assess if the actual output effectively addresses the specific information requirement stated in the input.", "Determine the comprehensiveness of the actual output in addressing all key aspects mentioned in the input.", "If there is not enough information in the retrieval context to correctly answer the input, and the actual output indicates that the input cannot be answered with the provided context, then return a score of 10."], "evaluation_params": ["input", "actual_output", "retrieval_context"]}}]}, "{\"actual_output\": \"Hypnosis can be helpful in dissociating somatic reaction from psychological reaction by teaching individuals to imagine their body floating in a safe and comfortable place while visualizing the stressful problem on an imaginary screen.

He's in that same mental state. People go into dissociative states when they're traumatized. So in a way, hypnosis is helping them remember and deal with the memories better because they're more in the mental state that is more like what happened. And most rape victims will tell you, I was floating above my body feeling sorry for the woman being assaulted below. People in traumatic episodes, they just say, you know, I blank out. I don't know what's happening. I'm on autopilot. And that's a kind of self-hypnotic state. So when you use hypnosis to help them deal with a traumatic memory, you're making the state they're in right there in your office with you more congruent to the state they were likely in when the trauma happened. And I think that is part of what helps facilitate treatment of trauma-related disorders. I see. So that makes me have to ask every question I have to ask, because I really feel it as almost a compulsion.\\n------------------------\\n\", \"\\nShow Summary: In Episode 60 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. David Spiegel, an expert in the clinical applications of hypnosis.
